# Introduction

ScreenplayJS is a [Fountain](https://fountain.io/) screenplay parser based on [fountain-js](https://github.com/mattdaly/Fountain.js) and [afterwriting-labs](https://github.com/ifrost/afterwriting-labs).

Have a screenplay written in Fountain and need it converted to an HTML format? ScreenplayJS can do just that.
