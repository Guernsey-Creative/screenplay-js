# Guernsey Bros

ScreenplayJS is used in the [GuernseyBros](https://www.guernseybros.com/) project. You can read their latest sketches, 
spec scripts, or feature length screenplays on their website. 

GuernseyBros uses VueJS, Nuxt, and ScreenplayJS to parse 
Fountain scripts into HTML, providing mobile responsive scripts and screenplays.
